# Trading System Architecture

> **Status**: ✅ Core Features Implemented (v1.0.0) | 🚧 Enhanced Features In Progress (v1.1.0)

## Overview

This is the main architecture documentation index for the Trading System. The architecture documentation has been split into focused documents for better maintainability and navigation.

## Architecture Documents

### Core Architecture

- **[Architecture Overview](architecture-overview.md)** - System overview, requirements, technology stack, communication patterns, security, monitoring, development workflow, configuration, performance, and future enhancements

- **[Services Architecture](architecture-services.md)** - Detailed breakdown of all six microservices (Data Ingestion, Strategy Engine, Execution, Risk Management, Analytics, Notification)

- **[Database Architecture](architecture-database.md)** - Database connectivity strategy, schema design, and concurrent access patterns

- **[UI Architecture](architecture-ui.md)** - Frontend design, Streamlit components, and backend API architecture

### Specialized Architecture

- **[Prefect Architecture](architecture-prefect.md)** - Prefect 3.4.14 orchestration strategy, service-specific flows, deployment configuration, and implementation plan

- **[Deployment Architecture](architecture-deployment.md)** - Local deployment strategy, service deployment, startup scripts, health monitoring, and production considerations

- **[Timezone Architecture](architecture-timezone.md)** - Comprehensive timezone handling strategy for UTC storage, EST trading operations, and CST user interface

## Architecture Summary

The Trading System is a production-grade algorithmic trading system designed for local deployment, focusing on equities trading through Alpaca with paper trading capabilities. The system uses:

- **Microservices Architecture**: Six core services orchestrated by Prefect
- **Technology Stack**: Python 3.11+, PostgreSQL, Redis, Prefect, Streamlit, FastAPI
- **Data Sources**: Polygon.io, Yahoo Finance, Alpaca API
- **Deployment**: Local machine (Windows 10) with all services running on a single machine
- **Orchestration**: Prefect 3.4.14 for workflow management
- **Frontend**: Streamlit multipage interface with Plotly visualizations
